## Sniffing remote machines

**Overview:** Project developed for academic purposes of the course of computer networks. Among many goals of the project were the execution and collection of *tcpdump* data on each peer, as well as sending the data collected by them to all peers. In addition, it was necessary to compare the chosen protocol **(SCTP)** with the others *(UDP and TCP)*. Check out the analysis below:
